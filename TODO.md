- look into the relevant GOSTs
- add more lint types:
  * lints for bold/italic (e.g. in headers)
  * issues with lists
  * issues with tables
  * issues with images (e.g. captions)
  * issues with ToC
  * page numbers
  * page size and other section data
  * formulae????
- make lint autofixing separate from diagnostic writing
- write GUI application (Avalonia or WinForms) for easier usage and step-by-step application of diagnostic autofixes
